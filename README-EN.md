## Presentation

This project was realized in the context of two Directed Works (TD) of the second semester in BUT Computer Science at the IUT of Lens.

<br>

The main objective was to familiarize oneself with the development of human-machine interfaces (IHM) through the design of a Four In A Line game, using the JavaFX framework.

<br>

## Objectives

In the context of this project, the different objectives were as follows:

- **Add and organize components** in an FXML interface.
- **Name and reference the components** of the interface in FXML format.
- **Generate and structure the code of the controller** associated with the view.
- **Manage user actions** in the controller.

In a second phase, more advanced objectives were addressed:

- __Cut the application following the principles *Model-View-Controller*__ to structure the project.
- **Dynamically initialize the view** based on the configuration defined in the model.
- **Transmit user actions** from the view to the model to update the game state.
- **Update the view based on model changes**, allowing a reactive and intuitive user interface.

<br>

## Areas for Improvement
The project is complete in the context of the TD, but it can still be improved. Here are some improvement tracks:

+ Improve the graphical interface to offer a better user experience.
+ Add visual animations to make the game more interactive and dynamic.
